# Authentication Options Comparison: Custom JWT (Logto) vs. Convex Auth

This document compares two approaches for handling authentication in our application: using a custom JWT provider (Logto) versus using the built-in Convex Auth.

## 1. Custom JWT Provider (Logto)

This is the approach we have been implementing so far. It involves using Logto as a separate service to handle user authentication, and then configuring Convex to trust the tokens issued by Logto.

### Pros:

*   **Full Control over UI:** You have complete control over the look and feel of your login, signup, and user management pages.
*   **Advanced Features:** Logto provides a rich set of features out of the box, such as social logins (Google, GitHub, etc.), passwordless authentication, and more.
*   **Decoupled Architecture:** Your authentication service is separate from your backend, which can be beneficial for more complex applications.

### Cons:

*   **Increased Complexity:** This approach is more complex to set up and manage. It requires configuring both Logto and Convex, and writing more client-side code to handle the authentication flow.
*   **Separate Service Management:** You need to manage and potentially pay for a separate service (Logto).

## 2. Built-in Convex Auth

Convex provides a built-in authentication system that is tightly integrated with the Convex platform. It handles user creation, email verification, and password management directly within Convex.

### Pros:

*   **Simplicity:** This is by far the easiest and fastest way to add authentication to a Convex application. The setup is minimal.
*   **No Separate Service:** There is no need to manage a separate authentication service or pay for another subscription.
*   **Pre-built UI Components:** Convex provides pre-built React components for login, signup, and user management, which can save a lot of development time.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Because it's built-in, the integration with Convex queries and mutations is seamless.

### Cons:

*   **Less UI Control:** You have less control over the look and feel of the authentication UI. You can style the pre-built components, but you can't completely redesign them.
*   **Limited Features:** It primarily supports email and password authentication. While this is sufficient for many applications, it doesn't offer the same range of features as a dedicated service like Logto (e.g., social logins).

## Recommendation

For this application, which has been described as "very simple", **I strongly recommend switching to the built-in Convex Auth.**

The primary benefits are the significant reduction in complexity and the speed of implementation. We can get a fully functional and secure authentication system up and running in a fraction of the time it would take to correctly implement and manage the custom Logto integration.

The features provided by Convex Auth (email/password login, user creation, etc.) are more than sufficient for the current needs of this project. We can always migrate to a custom provider like Logto in the future if the application's requirements become more complex.
